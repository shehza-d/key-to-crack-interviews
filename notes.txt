Three things every fresher is told that are absolutely useless.

1. You should not switch jobs too quickly-
If your job does not help you grow, both professionally and financially, you should leave. The more days you do a job being unhappy the more unfit you become for the next role.

2. It's your first job, you should do whatever you are thrown into-
Talk to your manager if you don't like what you're doing and it doesn't align with your long-term goals. Because everyone has to play the game, it only makes sense to pick the sport you want to play.

3. You are not allowed to have opinions-
You are not required to work in the same manner as your team. Inform the team if you are more productive starting earlier in the day. The same is true for everything that was previously not done correctly and is still being done. Having an opinion, with an open mind to learn, is far superior to having no opinion.

Most importantly, never accept a toxic work environment, never accept a job where you are discouraged to have a life outside of work. (THIS IS IMPORTANT)

You'd be surprised how simple it is to obtain the right things if you change your mindset to accepting nothing less.
